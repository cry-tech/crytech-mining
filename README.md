An ERC-20 token backed with hashrates. By purchasing 1 Token you own 1 Gigahash processing power of the mining device in CryTech’s farms forever. This lifetime hash power will mine for you until you sell your token. After deducting the fees and maintenance costs, your net proﬁt will be transferred to your account weekly. If a mining device is broken or outdated, it will be replaced with a new one (compensated from the maintenance costs), and you will not suﬀer any loss or expenses. The maintenance costs is a ﬁxed price per token which is clearly speciﬁed in the Smart Contract. The number of circulating tokens is controlled by a Smart Contract, so that there is no way to generate tokens without suﬃcient backing hashpower. The token will be liquidable by getting listed in Exchange(s) and you can cash it out whenever you want. In the second phase, the project will be implemented completely decentralized and will provide a platform for communication between the miners and investors, which means CryTech will have no control over the proces
